In some part this is likely because there is often an obvious method to find a fixed point by merely feeding a guessed fixed point into a function, taking the result and feeding it back into the function. By doing this repeatedly a fixed point is often found. This method (that we will call the \"Simple\" method) is often convergent but it is also often slow which can be prohibitive when the function itself is expensive.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"FixedPointAcceleration.jl","title":"FixedPointAcceleration.jl","text":"FixedPointAcceleration.jl aims to provide fixed point acceleration algorithms that can be much faster than the simple method. In total eight algorithms are implemented. The first is the simple method as described earlier.

Four algorithms for accelerating vector sequences are also implemented including the Vector Epsilon Algorithm (VEA), two minimal polynomial algorithms (MPE and RRE)  and Anderson acceleration.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"FixedPointAcceleration.jl","title":"FixedPointAcceleration.jl","text":"In this paper section 1 starts by with a brief explanation of fixed points before section 2 describes the acceleration algorithms provided by FixedPointAcceleration.jl.

These techniques will not generally work however if f  N^a rightarrow N^a where a is large. Consider for instance using a multidimensional Newtonian optimiser to minimise h(x) = (f(x) - x)^2. The estimation of gradients for each individual dimension may take an infeasibly long time. In addition this method may not make use all available information. Consider for instance that we know that the solution for x will be an increasing vector (so x_i  x_j for any entries of x  with i  j) but has many entries. This information can be preserved and used in the vector acceleration algorithms that we present but would be more difficult to exploit in a standard optimisation algorithm.","category":"page"},{"location":"1_FixedPoints/#","page":"1 Fixed point acceleration","title":"1 Fixed point acceleration","text":"FixedPointAcceleration.jl implements eight algorithms for finding fixed points. The first algorithm implemented in this package is the \"simple\" method which merely takes the output of a function and feeds it back into the function. For instance starting with a guess of x_0, the next guess will be x_1 = f(x_0). The guess after that will be x_2 = f(x_1) and so on. In some conditions f will be a contraction mapping and so the simple method will be guaranteed to converge to a unique fixed point (Stokey, Lucas & Prescott 1989). Even when this is the case however the simple method may only converge slowly which can be inconvenient. The other seven methods this package implements are designed to be faster than the simple method but may not be convergent for every problem.","category":"page"},{"location":"2_Algorithms/#Acceleration-algorithms-1","page":"2 Acceleration algorithms","title":"2 Acceleration algorithms","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"2_Algorithms/#.1-Newton-acceleration-1","page":"2 Acceleration algorithms","title":"2.1 Newton acceleration","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"2_Algorithms/#","page":"2 Acceleration algorithms","title":"2 Acceleration algorithms","text":"Here we will define g(x) = f(x) - x.
